&gt;<i> Another question, though. As far as i understand, when rdma read due

You are right.  Neither TCP nor RDMA will issue more than one
outstanding R2T, although TCP could do so if MaxOutstandingR2Ts
allows.  We have the flexibility to do more RDMA reads, and perhaps
can get better performance with the pipelining that would bring.  I
think it would be a minor modification to iscsid.c, but suggest you
hold off until we get your no-copy-PDU work in.  And even this work
we should sit on for a bit until Tomo has a chance to think about
the current set of patches.

I fixed one bug today (&quot;iscsi: do not lose tx state&quot;) and pushed up
a new git.  Hopefully Robin and others will help us shake out more
bugs.  We'll be running tests next week and taking a close look at
performance.
