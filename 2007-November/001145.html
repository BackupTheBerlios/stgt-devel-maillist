</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For RDMA, it is often nice to use data from a pool of pre-registered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; buffers.  To do this, the transport allocates memory for a response and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; passes it down to the devices to fill.  Some operations, though,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; allocate their own buffers and return that new memory instead.  These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; are usually small and the allocation is just done for convenience to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; avoid length bounds checking.  Copy the data into the provided transport
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; buffer instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I killed memory allocation in scsi device code (spc, mmc, sbc, smc)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and kill all the hacky memory management code. Now LLDs allocate and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free buffer for data transfer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But now you need two mallocs per command:  one for the task and one
</I>&gt;<i> for the (aligned) data.  Bidi needs three.  This will show up in
</I>&gt;<i> iser performance, but might be a worthwhile trade-off.  Maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> could add slabs for common sizes (ick).
</I>
I thought that iSER code already does something like that since you
use pre-registered buffer again and again.

glib also does something like that. So I don't think that this change
will effect performance much.


&gt;<i> I have a lot of rebasing to do after all your bidi buffer work.  It
</I>&gt;<i> looks like good changes so far, but I have a couple of concerns from
</I>&gt;<i> a brief peruse of the changes in git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zeroing out the data chunk for non-READ/WRITE commands.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> lots of OSD commands hidden inside the 0x7f extended format, and
</I>&gt;<i> other non-OSD non-SBC commands too.  Can we just move the zeroing to
</I>&gt;<i> where it is needed?  Like in each of the inquiry, etc.  This zeroing
</I>&gt;<i> was a major performance problem for iser.
</I>
Yeah, I added that hack because device type code is broken (assumes
that buffer is large enough and zero'ed out). We need to fix device
type code.


&gt;<i> Accessor and setter functions for scmd.  I don't see what value they
</I>&gt;<i> add.  Except maybe for the &quot;(void*)(unsigned long)&quot; ones.
</I>
I want to insulate LLDs from scsi_cmd internals like Linux scsi-ml
does. It enables us to change the structure freely in the future
without caring about device type code and llds.


&gt;<i> Also, building functions using cpp to glue names together breaks
</I>&gt;<i> things like ctags, cscope, and diff -p.  Curious to hear why you
</I>&gt;<i> like them.
</I>
Yeah, there are the pros and cons of using cpp magic. I prefer using
cpp magic than defining lots of similar functions. And I think that
linux scsi developers are already familiar with that (see the
transport classes).


&gt;<i> Thanks for working on this.  Bidi handling in bs_* will be much
</I>&gt;<i> cleaner now.
</I>
No problem. I wanted this cleanups before the code becomes bigger by
adding iSER, FCoE, etc.


&gt;<i>  I'll be away from email until 25 nov, but will look at
</I>&gt;<i> your changes in detail and rebase iser after.
</I>
Thanks. Until 25, I try to merge some of your iSER patches that
haven't been merged yet.
