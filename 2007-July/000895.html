+iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER)
+================================
+
+Background
+----------
+
+There is a draft specification at ietf.org to extend the iSCSI protocol
+to work on RDMA-capable networks as well as on traditional TCP/IP.  The
+current version is:
+
+	&quot;iSCSI Extensions for RDMA Specification&quot;, Mike Ko, 20-Oct-05,
+	&lt;draft-ietf-ips-iser-06.txt&gt;
+
+RDMA stands for Remote Direct Memory Access, a way of accessing memory
+of a remote node directly through the network without involving the
+processor of that remote node.  Many network devices implement some form
+of RDMA.  Two of the more popular network devices are InfiniBand (IB)
+and iWARP.  IB uses its own physical and network layer, while iWARP sits
+on top of TCP/IP (or SCTP).
+
+Using these devices requires a new application programming interface
+(API).  The Linux kernel has many components of the OpenFabrics software
+stack, including APIs for access from user space and drivers for some
+popular RDMA-capable NICs, including IB cards with the Mellanox chipset
+and iWARP cards from NetEffect, Chelsio, and Ammasso.  Most Linux
+distributions ship the user space libraries for device access and RDMA
+connection management.
+
+
+RDMA in tgtd
+------------
+
+The Linux kernel can act as a SCSI initiator on the iSER transport, but
+not as a target.  tgtd is a user space target that supports multiple
+transports, including iSCSI/TCP, and now iSER on RDMA devices.
+
+The iSER code was written by researchers at the Ohio Supercomputer
+Center in early 2007:
+
+	Dennis Dalessandro &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/stgt-devel">dennis at osc.edu</A>&gt;
+	Ananth Devulapalli &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/stgt-devel">ananth at osc.edu</A>&gt;
+	Pete Wyckoff &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/stgt-devel">pw at osc.edu</A>&gt;
+
+We wanted to use a faster transport to test the capabilities of an
+object-based storage device (OSD) emulator we had previously written.
+Our cluster has InfiniBand cards, and while running TCP/IP over IB is
+possible, the performance is not nearly as good as using native IB
+directly.
+
+A short technical report describing this implementation and some
+performance results is available at:
+
+	<A HREF="http://www.osc.edu/~pw/papers/iser-techreport.pdf">http://www.osc.edu/~pw/papers/iser-techreport.pdf</A>
+
+The code mostly lives in iscsi/iscsi_rdma.c, with a few places in
+iscsi/iscsid.c that check if the transport is RDMA or not and behave
+accordingly.  iSCSI already had the idea of a transport, with just the
+single TCP one defined.  We added the RDMA transport and virtualized
+some more functions where TCP and RDMA behave differently.
+
+
+Design Issues
+-------------
+
+In general, a SCSI system includes two components, an initiator and a
+target. The initiator submits commands and awaits responses.  The target
+services commands from initiators and returns responses.  Data may flow
+from the initiator, from the client, or both (bidirectional).  The iSER
+specification requires all data transfers to be started by the target,
+regardless of direction.  In a read operation, the target uses RDMA
+Write to move data to the initiator, while a write operation uses RDMA
+Read to fetch data from the initiator.
+
+
+1. Memory registration
+
+One of the most severe stumbling blocks in moving any application to
+take advantage of RDMA features is memory registration.  Before using
+RDMA, both the sending and receiving buffers must be registered with the
+operating system.  This operation ensures that the underlying hardware
+pages will not be modified during the transfer, and provides the
+physical addresses of the buffers to the network card.  However, the
+process itself is time consuming, and CPU intensive.  Previous
+investigations have shown that for InfiniBand, with a nominal transfer
+rate of 900 MB/s, the throughput drops to around 500 MB/s when memory
+registration and deregistration are included in the critical path.
+
+Our target implementation uses pre-registered buffers for RDMA
+operations.  In general such a scheme is difficult to justify due to the
+large per-connection resource requirements.  However, in this
+application it may be appropriate.  Since the target always initiates
+RDMA operations and never advertises RDMA buffers, it can securely use
+one pool of buffers for multiple clients and can manage its memory
+resources explicitly.  Also, the architecture of the code is such that
+the iSCSI layer dictates incoming and outgoing buffer locations to the
+storage device layer, so supplying a registered buffer is relatively
+easy.
+
+
+2. Event management
+
+There is a mismatch between what the tgtd event framework assumes and
+what the RDMA notification interface provides.  The existing TCP-based
+iSCSI target code has one file descriptor per connection and it is
+driven by readability or writeability of the socket.  A single poll
+system call returns which sockets can be serviced, driving the TCP code
+to read or write as appropriate.  The RDMA interface can be used in
+accordance with this design by requesting interrupts from the network
+card on work request completions.  Notifications appear on the file
+descriptor that represents a completion queue to which all RDMA events
+are delivered.
+
+However, the existing sockets-based code goes beyond this and changes
+the bitmask of requested events to control its code flow.  For instance,
+after it finishes sending a response, it will modify the bitmask to only
+look for readability.  Even if the socket is writeable, there is no data
+to write, hence polling for that status is not useful.  The code also
+disables new message arrival during command execution as a sort of
+exclusion facility, again by modifying the bitmask.  We cannot do this
+with the RDMA interface.  Hence we must maintain an active list of tasks
+that have data to write and drive a progress engine to service them.
+The need for progress is tracked by a counter, and the tgtd event loop
+checks this counter and calls into the iSER-specific while the counter
+is still non-zero.  tgtd will block in the poll call when it must wait
+on network activity.  No dedicated thread is needed for iSER.
+
+
+3. Padding
+
+The iSCSI specification clearly states that all segments in the protocol
+data unit (PDU) must be individually padded to four-byte boundaries.
+However, the iSER specification remains mute on the subject of padding.
+It is clear from an implementation perspective that padding data
+segments is both unnecessary and would add considerable overhead to
+implement.  (Possibly a memory copy or extra SG entry on the initiator
+when sending directly from user memory.)   RDMA is used to move all
+data, with byte granularity provided by the network.  The need for
+padding in the TCP case was motivated by the optional marker support to
+work around the limitations of the streaming mode of TCP.  IB and iWARP
+are message-based networks and would never need markers.  And finally,
+the Linux initiator does not add padding either.
+
+
+Using iSER
+----------
+
+Compile tgtd with &quot;make ISCSI_RDMA=1&quot; to build iSER too.  You'll need to
+have two libraries installed on your system:  libibverbs.so and
+librdmacm.so.  If they are not installed in system paths, modify
+CFLAGS and LIBS to find them.
+
+The target will listen on all TCP interfaces (as usual), as well as all
+RDMA devices.  Both use the same default iSCSI port, 3260.  Clients on
+TCP or RDMA will connect to the same tgtd instance.
+
+To make your initiator use RDMA, make sure the &quot;ib_iser&quot; module is
+installed in your kernel.  Then do discovery as usual, over TCP, then
+type something like the following to change the transport type:
+
+	iscsiadm -m node -p $targetip -T $targetname --op update \
+	    -n node.transport_name -v iser
+
+Next, login as usual.  The negotiation phases go across TCP, then both
+sides switch to RDMA for full feature mode.
+
+Note that iSER does not use data or header digests.  This is a feature
+of the specification:  IB and iWARP use better checksums than TCP, so
+digesting is not needed in the application.
+
+
+Errata
+------
+
+The Linux kernel iSER initiator is currently lacking support for
+bidirectional transfers, and for extended command descriptors (CDBs).
+We'll send the patches for these soon.
+
+The Linux kernel iSER initiator uses a different header structure on its
+packets than is in the iSER draft specification.  This is described in
+an InfiniBand document and is required for that network, which only
+supports for Zero-Based Addressing.  If you are using a non-IB initiator
+that doesn't need this header extension, it won't work with tgtd.  There
+may be some way to negotiate the header format.  Using iWARP hardware
+devices with the Linux kernel iSER initiator should be fine, but has not
+been tested yet.
+
+There's no way to find out the IP address of a connecting initiator, so
+ACL support for network addresses is disabled in RDMA mode.  Anybody can
+connect if they are using RDMA.  CHAP authentication still works.
+
+The current code hard-codes the sizes of its resources.  This works fine
+for our particular initiator, but should be dynamic to support other
+initiators.  And Linux iSER does not support the
+MaxOutstandingUnexpectedPDUs parameter, making it rather difficult to
+implement there.
