<PRE>Hi,

I discovered Bacula's btape command and started using that to verify
my SSC implementation, and then discovered that I would have to
implement variable block size records in any case, so I switched.

I can now pass all the important Bacula btest tests, and many of the
unimportant ones like back space file, back space record, but there is
still at least one unimportant test that my code fails (space to just
past the very last record on the tape, but fixing that required a
careful reading of the spec ... :-). The code I have at the moment is
pretty crappy, and I might post it in a couple of weeks when I get
back from a cruise we are taking next week.

However, I thought I would describe the approach I have taken.

I keep all the metadata separate from the data. I have a separate
array of filemarks/setmarks (actually, I only implement filemarks at
the moment, but setmarks are not hard). This array can be small since
we don't expect many of them, and the cost of realloc to double its
size from 20 to 40 entries is not expensive and is only needed with
the WITE FILEMARKS(6) command.

I also have a separate array of record lengths. I size it for 1M
records at the moment, but the sizing of this array will depend on the
size of tape you are emulating and the record sizes you expect to
support. It seems that the default in programs like NetBackup is 64kB,
but they routinely recommend that you use 512kB or larger. 1M records
with 1MB record sizes means we can support 1TB backup tapes. Since
uncompressed LTO4s are 800GB (I am being a little loose here with MB
and MiB etc), and since compression can be done below the tape level,
1M records seems fine and requires 4MB per tape emulated. I would
probably return 64kB or more as the min Block Size (although I wonder
how many apps would support a granularity larger than 9 (16, for
example ...).

Every write writes its length to the next available record slot.

When reading, we keep track of the current record (starting at 0) and
read only the bytes of data the current record slot tells us
(actually, we should read the min of current record and the requested
size) and then deal with under-length or over-length reads as the spec
requests.

The filemarks array is used in this way. Marks occur before records.
If a mark is at the same offset as a record, the mark is first, and I
keep two variables, next_mark and next_record to tell me what I am up
to.

So, during a read, if there is a mark at the current offset, then a
CHECK_CONDITION should be returned with NO_SENSE and ASC_MARK.
However, if the request was an over-length read and there is a MARK
immediately after the read, a CHECK_CONDITION with NO_SENSE and NO_ASC
should be returned (at least by my reading of the spec).
Unfortunately, there are no programs that I am aware of that test for
these things (perhaps a useful additional tool for STGT would be a
program that does these sorts of tests). I am not sure that my code
handles this condition correctly, yet, as there is no test for it.

Spacing forward is a simple matter of lseeking using the block lengths
that I keep in my array of record sizes, and spacing backward is much
the same ...

My code currently does not handle writing over a MARK yet, but that is
only a matter of time, and I will probably write a stress test tool
first.

Also, I am not currently saving the metadata to files/xattrs nor
reading them in when a tape if mounted, but that is the easy part.

I have chosen this representation because performance in the data path
is important to me, especially during writing, but it is clear that
other representations can be used.

</PRE>
