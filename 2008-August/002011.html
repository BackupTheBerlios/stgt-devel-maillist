&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I discovered Bacula's btape command and started using that to verify
</I>&gt;<i> my SSC implementation, and then discovered that I would have to
</I>&gt;<i> implement variable block size records in any case, so I switched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can now pass all the important Bacula btest tests, and many of the
</I>&gt;<i> unimportant ones like back space file, back space record, but there is
</I>&gt;<i> still at least one unimportant test that my code fails (space to just
</I>&gt;<i> past the very last record on the tape, but fixing that required a
</I>&gt;<i> careful reading of the spec ... :-). The code I have at the moment is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty crappy, and I might post it in a couple of weeks when I get
</I>&gt;<i> back from a cruise we are taking next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I thought I would describe the approach I have taken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I keep all the metadata separate from the data. I have a separate
</I>&gt;<i> array of filemarks/setmarks (actually, I only implement filemarks at
</I>&gt;<i> the moment, but setmarks are not hard). This array can be small since
</I>&gt;<i> we don't expect many of them, and the cost of realloc to double its
</I>&gt;<i> size from 20 to 40 entries is not expensive and is only needed with
</I>&gt;<i> the WITE FILEMARKS(6) command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also have a separate array of record lengths. I size it for 1M
</I>&gt;<i> records at the moment, but the sizing of this array will depend on the
</I>&gt;<i> size of tape you are emulating and the record sizes you expect to
</I>&gt;<i> support. It seems that the default in programs like NetBackup is 64kB,
</I>&gt;<i> but they routinely recommend that you use 512kB or larger. 1M records
</I>&gt;<i> with 1MB record sizes means we can support 1TB backup tapes. Since
</I>&gt;<i> uncompressed LTO4s are 800GB (I am being a little loose here with MB
</I>&gt;<i> and MiB etc), and since compression can be done below the tape level,
</I>&gt;<i> 1M records seems fine and requires 4MB per tape emulated. I would
</I>&gt;<i> probably return 64kB or more as the min Block Size (although I wonder
</I>&gt;<i> how many apps would support a granularity larger than 9 (16, for
</I>&gt;<i> example ...).
</I>
NetBackup uses a 1k block for media header and image header information.

On a tape load, the 'bptm' process requests a '64k read'. If it
receives anything other then 1k of data, it rejects the tape as not
being in NetBackups format.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every write writes its length to the next available record slot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When reading, we keep track of the current record (starting at 0) and
</I>&gt;<i> read only the bytes of data the current record slot tells us
</I>&gt;<i> (actually, we should read the min of current record and the requested
</I>&gt;<i> size) and then deal with under-length or over-length reads as the spec
</I>&gt;<i> requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The filemarks array is used in this way. Marks occur before records.
</I>&gt;<i> If a mark is at the same offset as a record, the mark is first, and I
</I>&gt;<i> keep two variables, next_mark and next_record to tell me what I am up
</I>&gt;<i> to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, during a read, if there is a mark at the current offset, then a
</I>&gt;<i> CHECK_CONDITION should be returned with NO_SENSE and ASC_MARK.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if the request was an over-length read and there is a MARK
</I>&gt;<i> immediately after the read, a CHECK_CONDITION with NO_SENSE and NO_ASC
</I>&gt;<i> should be returned (at least by my reading of the spec).
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, there are no programs that I am aware of that test for
</I>&gt;<i> these things (perhaps a useful additional tool for STGT would be a
</I>&gt;<i> program that does these sorts of tests). I am not sure that my code
</I>&gt;<i> handles this condition correctly, yet, as there is no test for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spacing forward is a simple matter of lseeking using the block lengths
</I>&gt;<i> that I keep in my array of record sizes, and spacing backward is much
</I>&gt;<i> the same ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My code currently does not handle writing over a MARK yet, but that is
</I>&gt;<i> only a matter of time, and I will probably write a stress test tool
</I>&gt;<i> first.
</I>I've yet to find any program that uses setmarks..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I am not currently saving the metadata to files/xattrs nor
</I>&gt;<i> reading them in when a tape if mounted, but that is the easy part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have chosen this representation because performance in the data path
</I>&gt;<i> is important to me, especially during writing, but it is clear that
</I>&gt;<i> other representations can be used.
