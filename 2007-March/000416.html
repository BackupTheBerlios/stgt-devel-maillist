Subject: [Stgt-devel] your recent sense checkin

&gt;<i> I took a look at your SVN and rebased my patches on top of it.
</I>
Oh, thanks a lot. I can take care of you patches. I need to clean up
something before merging them.


&gt;<i>  One thing to point out: it should be possible for a target to send
</I>&gt;<i> back both data-in bytes as the result of a command, and status bytes
</I>&gt;<i> in the response.  Your use of task-&gt;addr to get the status bytes
</I>&gt;<i> appears to make that impossible.  I had added extra task-&gt;sense and
</I>&gt;<i> task-&gt;senselen to accommodate this usage.
</I>
Yeah. We've been fixing sense issues in tgt in-kernel component.

You add:

@@ -94,6 +94,8 @@ struct scsi_cmd {

 	unsigned char sense_buffer[SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE];
+	uint8_t *sense;    /* output values from target */

scsi_cmd structure has two sense_buffer. one is for some lld and one
is a pointer for odd llds.

Then, you add super long sense buffer to struct iscsi_connection:

@@ -146,6 +148,7 @@ struct iscsi_connection {
 	struct iscsi_pdu req;
 	void *req_buffer;
 	struct iscsi_pdu rsp;
+	uint8_t sense_buffer[252];  /* architectural limit */


I just want to have one sense_buffer in scsi_cmd even even if it's
large.

The problem is that tgt in-kernel component can't accept unaligned
buffer for sense (and as you pointed out, we wrongly use uaddr and len
fields in cmd_rsp struct for sense). I've been testing the patches.
When I finish it, I can fix tgtd.


&gt;<i> Regarding the &quot;Need to clean up this mess&quot; comment in
</I>&gt;<i> iscsi_scsi_cmd_tx_start:  it gets worse once we mix in the
</I>&gt;<i> bidirectional.  There you cannot do a phase collapse on the final
</I>&gt;<i> data packet, so it becomes even more of a mess.
</I>
Nice.


&gt;<i> I have cleaned most of that mess up, perhaps, as part of getting
</I>&gt;<i> bidirectional transfers to work, but the patches are not ready for
</I>&gt;<i> submission to stgt because they depend on AHS structures defined
</I>&gt;<i> only in non-mainline kernel patches.  If you are willing to remove
</I>&gt;<i> the dependency on kernel headers by copying the relevant bits into
</I>&gt;<i> stgt, we can avoid that problem.
</I>
I'm ok with using the nice header instead of upstream header files.


&gt;<i> Note the duplication in iscsi_cmd_rsp_build and
</I>&gt;<i> iscsi_sense_rsp_build; wouldn't it be better to have a single
</I>&gt;<i> function with &quot;if (task-&gt;result != 0) {...}&quot; to return status?
</I>
Probabaly.


&gt;<i> Here they are, fyi.  Let me know if you have suggestions on how I
</I>&gt;<i> can help you get more of this merged.
</I>
Sorry for taking so long to merge your patches. Surely, I'll merge
your patches.

I'll try to finish multiple device support sutff this weekend. Yeah, I
did last week and fixed AIO stuff instead. tgtd works with any
upstream kernels. It's as neat as multiple device support, isn't it ;)
