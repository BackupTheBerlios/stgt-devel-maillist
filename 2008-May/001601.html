<PRE>I think that for MMC there is very little metadata that would be nice to have.
I think MMC could benefit from storing (feature 0x0109) MediaSerialNumber
maybe also barcode (if used with SMC as a dvd jukebox) and possibly other
MAM attributes as well.

I think none of these are that important really (a lot of DVD players
can not return feature 0x0109 anyway :-) )

It would be nice to store MediaSerialNumber and also a Barcode
together with the &quot;image&quot; file for MMC.
I dont know how much other MAM data that applications using a MMC
jukebox expects/require for the jukebox functionality to work.

Since &quot;iso image&quot; is a &quot;standard/common&quot; fileformat for storing
&quot;images of CD/DVD disks&quot; and a lot of tools exist for using
such iso images,   I think it would be attractive if our &quot;images&quot; were
compatible, which kind of requires that we do not store this metadata
in the filedata itself.
Extended attributes would be one possible avenue to store this
metadata without &quot;polluting&quot; hte data and make us incompatible.


SSC is different.
First it likely requires a LOT of metadata. Second, I dont think there
is a de-facto standard   or tools   to operate on a &quot;raw-tape-image&quot;
anyway
so there shouldnt be anything that the images have to be compatible
with in the first place.


The biggest question for &quot;how much metadata does MMC need&quot; would
probably be when combined with SMC into a jukebox.
I have no idea how much/what metadata that a jukebox controller
program wants/needs to be happy.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatible and work with the myriad of &quot;Virtual/Phantom DVD Drive&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and drivers on other systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This compatibility would fail for me if I store metadata at the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Yeah, you can mount the file as an .ISO   but you have to strip off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first xMByte of the file first :-(   compared to &quot;the file is just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a normal .ISO image so its compatible with anything under the sun (but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it also has some invisible extra metadata stored at the side)&quot;. )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you said, we need to consider both the pros and cons of using
</I>&gt;<i> metadata. People are happy to give up the compatibily and use virtual
</I>&gt;<i> disk images (like QCOW, VMDK, and VHD) for snapshot. I think that just
</I>&gt;<i> for something trivial like serial number is not a good idea. Does the
</I>&gt;<i> metadata give something huge for mmc and ssc (like snapshot for sbc)?
