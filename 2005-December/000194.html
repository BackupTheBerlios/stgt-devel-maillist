Why do you think it needs any upper limit size? Would you like also any 
upper limits on sizes of the page or slab caches? I don't see any 
difference between them and sgv_pool. Let it allocate and keep unused as 
much memory as possible until it would be notified about memory pressure 
and ask to free some. Similarly as slab does.

BTW, from our experience, initiators tend to send commands without limit 
and in case if actual SCSI device isn't so fast to serve all of them 
with the rate, which they arrive, incoming queued commands very quickly 
eat all system memory with obvious consequences. So, there must be some 
kind of IO-throttling, when after some watermark the initiators start 
receiving TASK QUEUE FULL, which calm them down. I implemented very 
stupid one: don't let more than 32 commands per session. This let scst 
survive under extreme loads. You can think about something smarter  :-)
