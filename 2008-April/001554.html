I finally got a chance to look at this just now.  I think you mean
default is InitialR2T=No above, which means no unsolicited data.
That is the default case, and true, the two different meanings
of the initiator-supplied VA coincide.

But you missed the impact of immediate data.  We run with the
defaults (I think) that say the first write request packet should be
filled with a bit of the coming data stream.  From iscsid.conf:

    # To enable immediate data (i.e., the initiator sends unsolicited data
    # with the iSCSI command packet), uncomment the following line:
    #
    # The default is Yes
    node.session.iscsi.ImmediateData = Yes

Looking at the offset printed out by your patch, it is indeed
non-zero for the first RDMA read.  Please correct me if I am
mistaken about this---you must have tested all four variations of
with and without the patches on initiator and target side, but I did
not.

Hence I am still a bit unhappy about having to deal with the
fallout, with no way to detect it.  For our local use, I'll keep an
older version of stgt in use until we switch to a new kernel, then
merge up the target side change.  It is a bother, but I can deal
with it.  For other institutions, this lockstep upgrade requirement
will not be obvious until they debug the resulting data corruption.

Still, I do understand why it would be nice to conform to the spec,
and it is maybe a bit cleaner that way too.  Maybe you can help with
the bug reports on stgt-devel during the transition, and maintain
and publish a patch to let it work with old kernels.
