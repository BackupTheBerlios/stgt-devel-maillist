Subject: [Stgt-devel] scsi-target git tree
Message-ID: <20060306102330B.tomof@acm.org>

James created the scsi-target git tree (James, thanks a lot):

master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-target-2.6.git

It is based on the third submission and we've made some changes after
that. We'll send paches to scsi-ml for synchronizing it with the
latest in the subversion tree. Then we will work on the git tree
directly about in-kernel tgt code.

Subject: [Stgt-devel] IBM vscsi target driver
Message-ID: <20060315133449X.fujita.tomonori@lab.ntt.co.jp>

Hi James and Linda,

I've added TMF support to tgt and the ibmvstgt driver (though it has
not tested heavily yet) so that the driver provides the features that
the original ibmvscsis does and it is ready for wider exposure, I
think.

I'm thinking about submitting ibmvstgt after the patchset that I've
submitted to scsi-ml is merged to the scsi-target tree.

Here's a couple of questions before that:

a) naming ?

I have no preference in the driver name as long as it meets the
criteria for the mainline inclusion. Are IBM guys happy about
'ibmvstgt'? or any suggestions?

b) IB's srp.h

IB people created include/scsi/srp.h. Does the driver need to use it
instead of the old srp header file (drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/srp.h) to
go into the scsi-target tree?

Fujita, I don?t think you should include IBM in the name. What?s wrong 
with "vstgt" ?

I'm not sure. The driver (ibmvstgt) works only for IBM pSeries.


tgt provides common features for all SCSI target drivers (tgt has been
already merged into the scsi-target git tree and the -mm tree).

ibmvstgt is a driver for IBM pSeries's virtual machine
environments. It works with tgt.

Nothing per see, but there's a fair chance we'll get various different
virtual scsi targets..  The initiator side also has the ibm in the
name.

                                               Hi!


Shure, but if you want to use ibm in the name, I would be worried about
copyright issues. You better make shure ibm is giving their support on
this, otherwise they could send their laywers, and that is something we
want to avoid, isn?t it?

We have sent some patches to scsi-ml:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=114199144502121&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=114246767604419&w=2

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=114246767700080&w=2


you can get the latest tgt code by applying all the patches to the
scsi-target git tree.
