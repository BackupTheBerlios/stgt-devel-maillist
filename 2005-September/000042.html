Umm, I was just reccomending a work queue becuase you can create them 
either as a one thread per proc or a single threaded one. So if you like 
the work queue interface you can just create a bunch of 
single-threaded-workqueuues instead of creating a bunch of threads.

</I>
Are you creating a thread per command that can get queued or how do you 
determine how many threads?

  I don't think that
&gt;<i> having lots of kernel threads is so bad, though it makes the stgt code
</I>&gt;<i> complicated and dirty a bit. So I'll try AIO later with work queue per
</I>&gt;<i> target. Work queue per device is not necessary, though it fit for
</I>&gt;<i> SAM-3 theoretically.
</I>
ok then.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last topic is that how to prevent a device from being removed (by

</I>&gt;<i> queuecommand from putting new commands to the device. Then,
</I>&gt;<i> stgt_device_destory() calls flush_workqueue() to wait all commands to
</I>&gt;<i> finish and then frees the resources.
</I>
That sounds about right. We also will have to deal with people suddenly 
removing targets too. I mean someone just yanking the controller from 
the box :) We are going to have to do some more lifetime management for 
this.
