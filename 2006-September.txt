Message-ID: <200609031133.k83BX0BR006206@r-dd.iij4u.or.jp>

Seems that the user-space iSCSI target driver is ready for people who
are interested in iSCSI target development. It provides the very basic
features with reasonable performance (should be comparable with
IET). As long as the initiators and network work well, the target
driver should be ok.

svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/stgt/trunk

Next steps are fixing error handling code and implementing a handy
configuration scheme.


Tom, I've just started to add some transport code though it still
needs lots of work.

Tomo:

Fantastic, I'll take a look.

Thanks,
Tom

Here's a quick explanation of the user-space driver concept (it is not
mentioned in the OLS paper).

The majority of tgt drivers live in kernel space and send SCSI
commands to the user-space daemon through shared memory between kernel
and user space (we used netlink for this in the past) via in-kernel
tgt part. The user-space daemon provides SCSI-target common features:
SCSI protocol processing, logical unit and target device management,
etc.

In the user-space driver concept, tgt drivers live in user space and
directly send SCSI commands to the user-space daemon via user-space
tgt APIs (tgt and user-space drivers are complied to a single
binary). The drivers still enjoy the common features though there is
no kernel involvement.

The user-space iSCSI target driver is the first example. I guess that
SRP and SBP target driver could live in user space too.

The README.iscsi file in the doc directory should be useful if you try
the iSCSI target driver.
