</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocated, there isn't a means of getting data to be written via sg down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this code path.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

That sounds fine, how can we make the lld in kernel space aware that the
target is pass-through?  

Should the kernel driver operate as usual and queue the command to tgtd
and then tgtd would see that it's a pass-through target and communicate
back to the lld that the command should be processed in-kernel?  I think
that's probably the simplest method of achieving this without making
the kernel drivers aware of all target configuration and status but it
would mean a trip to tgtd for every command.  Otherwise we'd want to
communicate every change in configuration for the targets to the kernel
lld's and any other operational changes for tgtd.  Thoughts?
