</I>&gt;<i> I was proposing a 1:1 relationship of initiator to target within the
</I>&gt;<i> target framework for in-kernel pass-through.  We would still have the

</I>
In principle, yes, but, as usually, on practice it's not so easy. In 
your file system example the device is accessed via the FS, which 
provides a shared mode, and everybody doesn't have any need to do 
anything directly with the device. But in case of non-disk devices they 
are always accessed directly, so to explain your limitation you will 
have to write it with HUGE letters everywhere. Once one SCST user 
cleared Unit Attention on his exported tape device using st driver and 
asked then me why it isn't delivered to his remote initiator.

&gt;&gt;<i>2. 1:1 relationship is a serious limitation for usage cases like an SPI 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>tape library serving backup for several servers on an FC net.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Restricting the relationship to 1:1 would be for pass-through devices
</I>&gt;<i> only, this would not necessarily dictate other target types which could
</I>&gt;<i> be used for such cases.
</I>
The tape library from my example is the pass-through device. You can't 
access a parallel SCSI (SPI) device on an Fibre Channel (FC) in any 
other mode, right?
