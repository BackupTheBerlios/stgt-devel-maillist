</I>
I was proposing a 1:1 relationship of initiator to target within the
target framework for in-kernel pass-through.  We would still have the
case that local access on the target is possible; an administrator with
privileges neccessary to create a target would have the responsibility
to not then access the device locally.  

This is no different than if I create my root file system on /dev/sda1,
I should not also 'dd' data to /dev/sda1 while the system is running.
It's a bad idea, but nothing stops me; however this is something that
only a root level user can do.  This would be the same, these targets in
pass-through have permissions by default that do not allow local access
by non-root users.

&gt;<i> 2. 1:1 relationship is a serious limitation for usage cases like an SPI 
</I>&gt;<i> tape library serving backup for several servers on an FC net.
</I>
Restricting the relationship to 1:1 would be for pass-through devices
only, this would not necessarily dictate other target types which could
be used for such cases.
