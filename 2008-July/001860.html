Go ahead, it shouldn't be too much work anyway ;)

One thing which still needs to be contemplated: tgt-admin works with 
iscsi driver only right now (and has some &quot;--lld iscsi&quot; hardcoded).

tgtd is supposed to work with other drivers, too, so it would make sense 
to support them as well.

What about other drivers? Are they stable?

According to README.fcoe, &quot;this driver is not stable at all&quot;.
ibmvstgt? Are there any other drivers (planned)?


That being said: I wanted to add support for &quot;dumping&quot; current tgtd 
configuration into a config file, i.e. tgt-admin --dump (perhaps there 
are better names for this option) would read all configured targets 
(tgtadm --op show --mode target) and print a nice config file out of it. 
Obviously, it wouldn't show passwords, as tgtadm doesn't show them.

Do you think such feature would be useful?
