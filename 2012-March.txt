driver more smoothly (especially on the user-space daemon).


-- iSCSI

Now we don't know where iSCSI tcp for generic NICs and iSER drivers
live. We will post kernel-space part of iSCSI tcp to scsi-ml for
discussion. If we fail to put it into mainline, I'll implement iscsi
target software in user space, which uses tgt user-space code.

We like to support iSCSH HBAs like qla4xxx, but we need to see whether
vendors provide their drivers and info.


-- FC

Mike has been working on qla2xxx. Probably, we need to try to add
target support to scsi_transport_fc first because we will support
other FC HBAs.

I will work on fc support too, but it depends on how other work goes.

the target is the 'ACL', so all setup can be safely performed before
allowing any initiator to 'see' the target(s).


My main issue with passing this information on the command line is:
a. Length & complexity of the command.
b. Limiting the changes to the existing code base - Trying to keep the
SSC/SMC code as separate as possible.

e.g. Product Ident, Vendor Ident, Serial number etc.

However for a changer (SMC) the list is much longer.
i.e.
 - Product Ident, Vendor Ident, Serial Num etc (same as SSC list)
 - Starting number and quantity of storage slots (Storage Elements)
 - Starting number and quantity of mailslots/CAP (Import/Export Elements)
 - Starting number and quantity of picker arms (Medium Transport)
 - Starting number and quantity of devices (Data Transport Elements)
 - Type of each Data Transport Element (sbc, ssc etc)
 - The contents of each slot (populate the Library with virtual media)


I shall attempt to put together some ideas about the tgtadm syntax and
post to the list for comment.

Regards
Mark

can't (yeah, user-space code does something like that, but it's
wrong. it needs be fixed). We need to bind a scsi_host to a tgt
scsi_host (please read the previous pass-through discussion).
